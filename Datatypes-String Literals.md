# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
<img width="840" height="234" alt="503734412-f9366dda-4a21-43d6-908a-c6df0d2e2b92" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/628c079a-a1d6-42f7-9dbf-4865e534cd12" />
